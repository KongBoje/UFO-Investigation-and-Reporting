### 3 most biggest problems encountered and longest to solve
- Problem 1 for me was to completely figure out how to really establish a connection via LinQpad to a mySQL database. I first tried to use the options that were already displayed in the connection tab but when I tried to connect it didn't work. I did this for too long in my opinion until I found a solution to this on Stackoverflow (hooray for that site). I simply had to go and view for more drivers and download the IQ driver, from there I just had to use the connection string given to me by Kasper.

- Problem 2 was to figure out what was meant with Client-side-joins and why it was a bad thing in LinQ and mySQL. So this took really long for me, since when I searched for sites to help me explain about how and why to prevent it I still didn't really understand it. After some more searching about it I did however find some explanations that made me understand it better. It's simply to prevent decrease in performance for tables to join on the client. I could then find some better examples on this.

- I didn't really have a third problem with doing this exercise but it was probably to think of how to best do this exercise, cause I have never really done one like this before, or maybe I have I just can't remember it. The thing with the 30 min diary was new to me, I haven't kept exact track of what I did ecery 30 minute, cause sometimes I have been deep in thought while doing this and by doing that I forget about the time and what I did during that time.

### How to avoid problems like these in the future
I don't really know how to exactly answer this question but probably rely more on comments and posts on the blocks and articles you search for. Sometimes I just looked at the block and moved on which was a mistake on my part.
