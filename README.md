### 3 most biggest problems encountered and longest to solve
- Problem 1 for me was to completely figure out how to really establish a connection via LinQpad to a mySQL database. I first tried to use the options that were already displayed in the connection tab but when I tried to connect it didn't work. I did this for too long in my opinion until I found a solution to this on Stackoverflow (hooray for that site). I simply had to go and view for more drivers and download the IQ driver, from there I just had to use the connection string given to me by Kasper.

- Problem 2 was to figure out what was meant with Client-side-joins

- Problem 3 waow


### How to avoid problems like these in the future
