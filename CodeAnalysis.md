### Exercise 1
I ran the analysis with the following command: "./run.sh pmd -d ~/Documents/NetBeansProjects/Gutenberg-book-project -R category/java/codestyle.xml -f html > ~/pmdresult.html" on this project:
- https://github.com/KongBoje/Gutenberg-book-project

I got the following PMD report on this project with the category being condestyle.xml:
- https://github.com/KongBoje/UFO-LinQ-Investigations/blob/master/files/PMDReport.pdf

- 2: 

### Exercise 2
- Source code link
- Report on profile result and explain what is seen.
- Micro-benchmark if possible
